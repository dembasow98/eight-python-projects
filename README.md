## LEARN PYTHON WITH 8 PYTHON GAMES

In this reposiroty, I have implemented 8 python games to help me learn python.
Below is the ennumaration of the games from sorted by difficulty.

`Note: All the games are generater on console.`

### 1. Guess the Number:
  The game is simple. <br/>
  The user has to guess the randomly generated number that lies between the range from X to Y.<br/>
  Where X and Y are the user input. <br/>
  That’s it.<br/>
  
### 2. Rock Paper Scissors:
Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people. <br/> 
In this game, scissors can beat paper, paper can beat rock, and rock can beat scissors.
Here the computer will give a random output.

### 3. Random Password Generator:
The algorithm will use the `random` libraries to combine some output with <br/>
some string and numbers and characters, to generate a password.
### 4. Hangman:
The Hangman Game In Python is written in a python programming language, <br/>
In this Hangman Game Project is to implement the Hangman Game Using Python. 
It doesn’t require any specific modules other than random and time. 
Python loops and functions are enough to build this game here.

### 5. Tic-Tac-Toe:
This game and the following games are kind of mid-high level.
There will be two players in a game. Two signs represent each player. 
The general signs used in the game are X and O. Finally, there will be a board with 9 boxes.
* Here the unbeatable AI is also implemented.
* 2 AI plays with each others.


### 6. Binary Search:
In a nutshell, this search algorithm takes advantage of a collection of elements that 
is already sorted by ignoring half of the elements after just one comparison. 

* Compare x with the middle element.
* If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.
* Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. 
* Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.
* Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.

### 7. Minesweeper :

Minesweeper is a single-player game in which the player has to clear a 
square grid containing mines and numbers. 
The player has to prevent himself from landing on a mine with the help of numbers in the neighbouring tiles.

### 8. Sudoku Solver:

In the Sudoku puzzle, we need to fill in every empty box with an integer between 1 and 9 in such a way that every number from 1 up to 9 appears once in every row, every column, and every one of the small 3 by 3 boxes highlighted with thick borders.

The difficulty of this puzzle might vary. The more the difficulty level of Sudoku puzzles, the more challenging the research problem it becomes for computational scientists. Difficult puzzles mostly have less prescribed symbols.

The Sudoku puzzles which are published for entertainment have unique solutions. A Sudoku puzzle is believed to be well-formed if it has a unique solution. Another challenging research problem is to determine how few boxes need to be filled for a Sudoku puzzle to be well-formed. Well-formed Sudoku with 17 symbols exists. It is unknown whether or not there exists a well-formed puzzle with only 16 clues. The lesser the clues, the higher the chances of multiple solutions.
